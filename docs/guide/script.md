# Script Development

What can you achieve using scripts?

Everything that browser extensions can do, scripts can do as well. What browser extensions cannot do, scripts can also accomplish. This is because browser extension development comes with many limitations, and some features are even unavailable. However, in PakePlus scripts, there are no restrictions—it’s just like running the website’s own JavaScript code. Combined with powerful system-level APIs, it can deliver effects comparable to real software.

# Basic Concepts

To develop scripts, you first need to understand how websites operate.  
You can compare a website to a person: the website’s HTML code is the body, the CSS styles are the clothes, and the JavaScript interactions are the body movements.  
Thus, a website is composed of HTML + CSS + JavaScript. Of course, our scripts are written in JavaScript, which is the core component.

# Foundational Knowledge

A basic understanding of HTML + JavaScript + CSS is still necessary. However, with the availability of various AI tools today, it’s not a big issue if you’re not proficient. You can simply let AI write the code for you—it’s faster and easier.

# Video Tutorials

We will soon release some of the most basic and simple video tutorials. These will gradually be shared on major video platforms such as Bilibili, Douyin, YouTube, and others.
